Q: _What's the difference between the input and the holding registers in an I/O device_
A: Input registers are 16-bit registers used for input, and may only be read. Holding registers are the most universal 16-bit register, may be read or written, and may be used for a variety of things including inputs, outputs, configuration data, or any requirement for "holding" data.
